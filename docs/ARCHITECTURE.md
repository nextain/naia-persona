# Naia Ecosystem Architecture

> naia-adk is the personal base. Higher layers extend it for organizational governance and concrete company/member instances.

## Disclosure Levels

| Level | Meaning | Strategy | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| `public` | Safe for public repos and websites | open repo / public docs | skills, packages, templates, docs |
| `controlled` | Shareable externally with review | approved external sharing only | vetted partner material, approved brand assets |
| `internal` | Workspace or company internal | private repo / limited audience | `.agents/`, `data-company/`, internal documents |
| `confidential` | Sensitive operational or customer-bound material | private repo or outside git, need-to-know handling | `data-business/`, `data-private/`, `.env`, certificates, API keys |

Levels also imply different expectations for AI behavior:

- `public`: may be summarized and published
- `controlled`: may be shared externally only with intent and review
- `internal`: may be read and worked on, but not publicly published by default
- `confidential`: stronger need-to-know handling, caution for memory promotion, never treated as normal publishable context

## Model: Personal Base + Organizational Extension + Instances

| Layer | What | For Who |
|-------|------|---------|
| **naia-adk** | Personal base: scaffold + format + minimum solo governance | Individuals using AI-assisted workspaces |
| **naia-business-adk** | Organizational extension: assets / process / permissions governance | Teams and companies |
| **{company}-adk** | Company instance with real products, teams, and policy | Specific organization's AI operations |
| **{member}-adk** | Company-linked personal instance | Members working within company context |

## Solo Governance Baseline

The base layer should define a minimum collaboration model even for one person:

- `read`, `write`, `execute`, and `publish` are not the same action
- public, internal, confidential, and secret are not just storage tiers but disclosure semantics
- production mutation, secret handling, and public claims require stronger gates than local edits
- session-local context should not be promoted into persistent/shared context without intent

This belongs in `naia-adk` because solo AI collaboration can fail before any company layer exists.

## naia-adk Skill Trees (two trees, both ship in this base repo)

naia-adk has **two skill trees** with different SoTs and consumers. The disk is the
single source of truth; the lists below mirror it.

### `.agents/skills/` — AI-assistant / workflow tree

SoT for Claude Code (via `.claude/skills/` symlinks); indexed by
`.agents/context/skills-index.yaml`.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `review-pass` | 4-stage multi-AI cross-validation review |
| `verify-implementation` | Run all `verify-*` skills → unified report |
| `verify-contract-conformance` | Declared API/interface contract vs implementation |
| `manage-skills` | Detect drift, create/update `verify-*` skills |
| `merge-worktree` | Squash-merge worktree → main, semantic commits |
| `read-doc` | HWP/HWPX/PDF/DOCX/XLSX/PPTX text extraction |
| `webapp-testing` | Playwright E2E for local web apps |
| `doc-coauthoring` | Structured document co-authoring (3-step) |
| `project-create` / `project-migration` / `migrate-ctx` | Scaffold / extract / migrate workspace repos & context |
| `payroll` | 급여명세서 PDF + 이메일 발송 |
| `press-release` | 보도자료 작성·기자 조사·발송 |
| `patent-draft` | KIPO 특허 명세서 초안 |
| `patent-pipeline` | 특허 발굴·평가·출원 |
| `copyright-reg` | 어문저작권 등록 서류 |
| `weekly-report` | 주간 업무 결과 (git 커밋 기반) |

### `skills/` — operational / runtime tree

Discovered by the dashboard API (`core.discoverSkills()` scans `skills/**/SKILL.md`)
and served at `/api/skills`.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `email` | SMTP email with templates |
| `sms` | SMS / 알림톡 via gateway adapter |
| `notify` | Channel-agnostic notification |
| `channel-management` | Discord/Slack channel management |
| `service-management` | Service monitoring, cost, incident response |
| `web-monitoring` | SEO, uptime, analytics |
| `document-generation` | Branded PDF (contract/resolution/payroll) |
| `read-doc` · `doc-coauthoring` · `review-pass` | Also present here (dashboard-visible copies) |
| `config` · `cron` · `diagnostics` · `system-status` · `sessions` · `memo` · `skill-manager` · `time` · `weather` | Runtime utilities |

## naia-business-adk Skills (organizational extension)

`naia-business-adk` adds team-scoped governance and additional org skills on top of the
base trees above. Examples (not exhaustive, and not shipped in this base repo):

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `contract` | 근로계약서 (근로기준법) + 디지털 서명 |
| `expense` | 지출결의서 + 영수증 OCR |
| `accounting` | 장부 기록, 월마감, 세무 |
| `crm` | 파일 기반 경량 CRM |
| `client-communication` | 고객 소통 관리 |

## Organizational Governance Extension

`naia-business-adk` should not be described as a premium skill bundle only.

It is the organizational extension that adds:

- team ownership
- delegated approval
- need-to-know handling for customer/legal/finance data
- audit-ready workflow expectations
- business workflow classes and policy

Skills are one output of that extension, not the whole product.

## {company}-adk (Company Workspace)

At the organizational layer, `naia-business-adk` scaffolding creates:

```

## naia-os Integration

The active ADK instance serves as the **skill backend** for the naia-os desktop app:

```
naia-os (Desktop App, Tauri 2)
  └─ agent ──WebSocket/MCP──> {active-adk} Runtime
                                  ├─ Base skill execution
                                  ├─ Document generation (when provided by the active instance)
                                  ├─ Approval / org workflows (only in business/company layers)
                                  └─ MCP Server → expose skills to naia-os
```

Integration paths (phased):
1. **MCP**: naia-adk runs MCP Server → naia-os connects as MCP Client
2. **Gateway**: naia-adk implements `GatewayAdapter` → naia-os agent calls directly
3. **Shared SDK**: Extract `@naia/skill-sdk` from common interfaces

### alpha-adk (= company-linked personal instance)

`alpha-adk` is not a generic personal fork. It is a member instance that inherits company context while preserving local working memory and experiments.
